## Welcome to HTML, CSS and Javascript

You can use the [website link](https://vudeshmukh14.github.io/coursera-test/module5-solution/index.html) to view the website that I made for a coursera project.

This is a website for David Chu's China Bistro that I made using HTML, CSS and Javascript with few lines of Ajax.
